        <h1>The Witcher 1 </h1>
        <p> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">The Witcher </span> is a 2007 action role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by Atari on Microsoft Windows <br> 
            and CD Projekt on OS X, based on the novel series of The Witcher by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, taking place after the events of the main saga. <br> 
            The story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows Geralt of Rivia, one of a few traveling monster hunters who have supernatural powers,<br> 
            known as Witchers. The game's system of moral choices as part of the storyline was noted for its time-delayed consequences and lack of black-and-white morality. <br>
             The game utilizes BioWare's proprietary Aurora Engine. In 2009, a console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, <br>
             was scheduled for release using an entirely new engine and combat system. However, it was suspended as a result of payment problems with console developers Widescreen Games. <br>
              Two sequels were released: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015.</p>

        <h1>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings </h1>
        <p> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</span>  (Polish: Wiedźmin 2: Zabójcy królów) is a 2011 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red,<br> 
             based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to the 2007 game The Witcher and the second main installment in The Witcher's video game series. <br>
              It was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, OS X, and Linux.<br>
             The player directs the actions of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher (Warlock).<br>
             The fantasy world in which his adventures take place owes much to Polish history and Slavic mythology.<br>
            The game was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 1.7 million copies by May 2012. <br>
            The third installment in the series, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, was released in May 2015.</p>

        <h1>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h1>
        <p> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</span> is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by Polish developer CD Projekt Red<br>
             and is based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings<br>
              and the third main installment in the The Witcher's video game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective.<br>

            The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavonic mythology.<br>
             Players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt, an otherworldly force determined to capture her.<br>
              Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment.<br>
               Its central story has several endings, determined by the player's choices at certain points in the game.<br>
            
            Development began in 2011 and lasted for three and a half years. Central and Northern European cultures formed the basis of the game's world. REDengine 3 enabled the developer to<br>
             create a complex story without compromising the game's open world. The music was primarily composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz and performed by the Brandenburg State Orchestra.<br>
            
            The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in May 2015, with a Nintendo Switch version released in October 2019, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions<br>
             planning for release in 2021. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, narrative, world design, combat, and visuals, although it received minor criticism due to technical issues. It received numerous game of the year awards<br>
              and has been cited as one of the best video games ever made. Two expansions were also released to critical acclaim: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. A Game of the Year edition was released in August 2016, with the base game, expansions, and all downloadable content.<br>
               The game shipped over 28 million copies.</p>
